# PixelWeather

A TypeScript and Canvas web app for interactively displaying the weather for a given city. I developed this to accompany my talk [FrontCon](https://frontcon.lv/) talk, _Composing Classes with TypeScript_.

`master` currently contains a horrible implementation based upon inheritance, but will eventually be replaced by one based upon composition.
