# PixelWeather

A TypeScript and Canvas web app for interactively displaying the weather for a given city. I developed this to accompany my [FrontCon](https://frontcon.lv/) talk, _Composing Classes with TypeScript_.

This branch, `inheritance`, contains an initial implementation in which entity behaviours are reused via inheritance. The composed version can be found in `master`.
